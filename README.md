## <b>Layouts Included</b>

1. <b>LinearLayout</b>
   - <b>Description:</b> `LinearLayout` is a simple and flexible layout that arranges its children either horizontally or vertically in a single line.

2. <b>AbsoluteLayout</b>
   - <b>Description:</b> `AbsoluteLayout` allows you to specify the exact position (x, y coordinates) of its child views within the layout.
   - <b>Usage:</b> While it provides precise control, it's generally not recommended due to its lack of flexibility in handling different screen sizes and orientations.
